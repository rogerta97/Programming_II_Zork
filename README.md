# Programming_II_Zork
This is a repository in which I will be developing my own version of Zork text adventure:

1: In the first delivering, the unique funciontallity of the game is moving arround the map and being able to open one door, the comands 
must be inserted like: (action)(direction/item). 

You move with nort/south/east/west.
write "open" to open a door and "close" for closing it. 
write "quit game" for quiting the game. 
write "help me" for asking for help. 
write "look" to see what you have arround you.
