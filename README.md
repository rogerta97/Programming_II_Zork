# Programming_II_Zork
This is a repository in which I will be developing my own version of Zork text adventure.


1: In the first delivering, the unique funciontallity of the game is moving arround the map and being able to open one door, the comands 
must be inserted like: (action)(direction/item). 

<<<<<<< HEAD

2: In the second delivery I improved the following aspects: 
	- I deleted al the memory leaks. 
	- I split the program to the number of functions that were needed, not having all the program on CreateWorld();
	- I improved the general structure of the scanf_s in order to be more general. 
	- I made a new class called entity, this contains names and descrptions and each room and exit will have his own.
